## Introduction
This presentation aims to present all key findings and visualizations from the report with the WordBank dataset. It will include a title slide, a few content slides, and a concluding slide, with summaries of findings for all figures. 

---

# Data & Setup
```{python setup, include=False}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
df = pd.read_csv("/Users/mingketian/Desktop/MATH300/wdi.csv")
df.head()
```

---

## Visualisations and Findings
```{python}
# Distribution of GDP per Capita
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.histplot(df['gdp_per_capita'], bins=30, kde=True, color='blue')
plt.title("Distribution of GDP per Capita")
plt.xlabel("GDP per Capita (USD)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
```
GDP per Capita Distribution
The distribution is right-skewed, with most countries having low GDP per capita. A few wealthy nations push the upper limit, highlighting global economic disparity. The majority cluster at lower values, suggesting a large income gap between countries.

---

```{python}
# Inflation Rate Analysis
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.boxplot(x=df['inflation_rate'], color='orange')
plt.title("Boxplot of Inflation Rate")
plt.xlabel("Inflation Rate (%)")
plt.show()
```
Inflation Rate Boxplot
Inflation varies widely, with many outliers indicating extreme cases. Most countries have inflation rates within a moderate range, but a few experience hyperinflation. The long upper whisker suggests economic instability in some regions.

---

```{python, echo=False}
# Bar chart of GDP per capita
df_sorted = df.sort_values('gdp_per_capita', ascending=False)
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.barplot(data=df_sorted, x='gdp_per_capita', y='country', palette='viridis')
plt.title("GDP per Capita by Country")
plt.xlabel("GDP per Capita (USD)")
plt.ylabel("Country")
plt.yticks(rotation=0, ha='right')
plt.show()
```
GDP per Capita by Country
The bar chart shows a high concentration of countries with low GDP per capita, while a few nations have significantly higher values. The skewed distribution highlights global economic inequality, with wealth concentrated in a small number of countries.

---

```{python, echo=False}
# Scatter plot of inflation rate vs unemployment rate
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='inflation_rate', y='unemployment_rate', hue='country', palette='coolwarm', s=100, legend=False)
plt.title("Inflation Rate vs Unemployment Rate")
plt.xlabel("Inflation Rate (%)")
plt.ylabel("Unemployment Rate (%)")
plt.show()
```
Inflation Rate vs Unemployment Rate
The scatter plot reveals no clear correlation between inflation and unemployment, with most countries clustering at low inflation and unemployment rates. However, a few outliers show extreme values, indicating economic instability in certain nations.

---

Summary & Conclusion
GDP per Capita: Right-skewed distribution with high-income outliers.
Inflation Rate: Broad range with some extreme values.
Unemployment Rate: Varied across countries.
Overall: The analysis highlights diverse economic conditions across the world in 2022.
Thank you for your attention!
